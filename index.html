                It is increasingly common to model, simulate, and process complex
                materials based on loopy structures, such as in yarn-level cloth
                garments, which possess topological constraints between inter-looping
                curves. While the input model may satisfy specific topological linkages
                between pairs of closed loops, subsequent processing may violate those
                topological conditions. In this paper, we explore a family of methods
                for efficiently computing and verifying linking numbers between closed
                curves, and apply these to applications in geometry processing, animation,
                and simulation, so as to verify that topological invariants are preserved
                during and after processing of the input models. Our method has three stages:
                (1) we identify potentially interacting loop-loop pairs, then (2) carefully
                discretize each loop's spline curves into line segments so as to enable (3)
                efficient linking number evaluation using accelerated kernels based on either
                counting projected segment-segment crossings, or by evaluating the Gauss linking
                integral using direct or fast summation methods (Barnes-Hut or fast
                multipole methods). We evaluate CPU and GPU implementations of these methods
                on a suite of test problems, including yarn-level cloth and chainmail, that
                involve significant processing: physics-based relaxation and animation,
                user-modeled deformations, curve compression and reparameterization. We show
                that topology errors can be efficiently identified to enable more robust
                processing of loopy structures.

                3D weaving is an emerging technology for manufacturing multilayer woven textiles. In this work, we present Weavecraft:
                an interactive, simulation-based design tool for 3D weaving. Unlike existing textile software that uses 2D representations
                for design patterns, we propose a novel weave block representation that helps the user to understand 3D woven structures
                and to create complex multi-layered patterns. With Weavecraft, users can create blocks either from scratch or by loading
                traditional weaves, compose the blocks into large structures, and edit the pattern at various scales. Furthermore, users
                can verify the design with a physically based simulator, which predicts and visualizes the geometric structure of the
                woven material and reveals potential defects at an interactive rate. We demonstrate a range of results created with our
                tool, from simple two-layer cloth and well known 3D structures to a more sophisticated design of a 3D woven shoe, and we
                evaluate the effectiveness of our system via a formative user study.

              <div id="tamsiAbstract" class="collapse small">
                Multibody simulation with frictional contact has been a challenging subject of
                research for the past thirty years. Rigid-body assumptions are commonly used to
                approximate the physics of contact, and together with Coulomb friction, lead to
                challenging-to-solve nonlinear complementarity problems (NCP). On the other hand,
                robot grippers often introduce significant compliance. Compliant contact,
                combined with regularized friction, can be modeled entirely with ODEs, avoiding
                NCP solves. Unfortunately, regularized friction introduces high-frequency stiff
                dynamics and even implicit methods struggle with these systems, especially during
                slip-stick transitions. To improve the performance of implicit integration for
                these systems we introduce a Transition-Aware Line Search (TALS), which greatly
                improves the convergence of the Newton-Raphson iterations performed by implicit
                integrators. We find that TALS works best with semi-implicit integration, but that
                the explicit treatment of normal compliance can be problematic. To address this, we
                develop a Transition-Aware Modified Semi-Implicit (TAMSI) integrator that has
                similar computational cost to semi-implicit methods but implicitly couples compliant
                contact forces, leading to a more robust method. We evaluate the robustness, accuracy
                and performance of TAMSI and demonstrate our approach alongside relevant sim-to-real
                manipulation tasks.

                  Rigid-body impact sound synthesis methods often omit the ground sound. In this
                  paper we analyze an idealized ground-sound model based on an elastodynamic
                  halfspace, and use it to identify scenarios wherein ground sound is perceptually
                  relevant versus when it is masked by the impacting object’s modal sound or
                  transient acceleration noise. Our analytical model gives a smooth, closed-form
                  expression for ground surface acceleration, which we can then use in the Rayleigh
                  integral or in an “acoustic shader” for a finite-difference time-domain wave
                  simulation. We find that when modal sound is inaudible, ground sound is audible
                  in scenarios where a dense object impacts a soft ground and scenarios where the
                  impact point has a low elevation angle to the listening point.

                    We explore an integrated approach to sound generation that supports
                    a wide variety of physics-based simulation models and computer-animated
                    phenomena.  Targeting high-quality offline sound synthesis, we seek to resolve
                    animation-driven sound radiation with near-field scattering and
                    diffraction effects. The core of our approach is a sharp-interface
                    finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) wavesolver, with a series of supporting
                    algorithms to handle rapidly deforming and vibrating embedded interfaces
                    arising in physics-based animation sound. Once the solver rasterizes these
                    interfaces, it must evaluate acceleration boundary conditions (BCs) that involve
                    model and phenomena-specific computations. We introduce acoustic shaders as a
                    mechanism to abstract away these complexities, and describe a variety of
                    implementations for computer animation: near-rigid objects with
                    ringing and acceleration noise, deformable (finite element) models such as
                    thin shells, bubble-based water, and virtual characters. Since time-domain wave
                    synthesis is expensive, we only simulate pressure waves in a small region about
                    each sound source, then estimate a far-field pressure signal. To further
                    improve scalability beyond multi-threading, we propose a fully time-parallel
                    sound synthesis method that is demonstrated on commodity cloud computing
                    resources.  In addition to presenting results for multiple animation phenomena
                    (water, rigid, shells, kinematic deformers, etc.) we also propose 3D automatic
                    dialogue replacement (3DADR) for virtual characters so that pre-recorded
                    dialogue can include character movement, and near-field shadowing and
                    scattering sound effects.

                    Thin shells — solids that are thin in one dimension compared to the other
                    two — often emit rich nonlinear sounds when struck. Strong excitations can
                    even cause chaotic thin-shell vibrations, producing sounds whose energy
                    spectrum diffuses from low to high frequencies over time — a phenomenon
                    known as wave turbulence. It is all these nonlinearities that grant shells such
                    as cymbals and gongs their characteristic “glinting” sound. Yet, simulation
                    models that efficiently capture these sound effects remain elusive.
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a physically based, multi-scale reduced simulation method
                    to synthesize nonlinear thin-shell sounds. We first split nonlinear vibrations
                    into two scales, with a small low-frequency part simulated in a fully nonlinear
                    way, and a high-frequency part containing many more modes approximated
                    through time-varying linearization. This allows us to capture interesting
                    nonlinearities in the shells’ deformation, tens of times faster than previous
                    approaches. Furthermore, we propose a method that enriches simulated
                    sounds with wave turbulent sound details through a phenomenological
                    diffusion model in the frequency domain, and thereby sidestep the expensive
                    simulation of chaotic high-frequency dynamics. We show several examples
                    of our simulations, illustrating the efficiency and realism of our model.</p>

                    Many objects of interest in imaging, such as biological cells or turbulent air, are phase-only objects that are transparent and thus produce little to no contrast in wide-field microscopes. The phase accumulated by this light carries important information about the refractive index and the thickness of the object. We propose a method for retrieving the phase by using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to conjugate the phase of the object, flattening the wavefront of light passing through the SLM and the object. After we flatten the wavefront, the resulting configuration on the SLM is the conjugate of the phase image, which we can easily invert to recover the original phase image. This method retrieves the phase without using any prior knowledge about the object.
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our algorithm performs a decomposition of the image into basis functions and searches for the coefficients that yield the flattest output intensity pattern. This algorithm takes advantage of the fact that a relatively small number of basis elements can store the majority of the information in the image. Popular phase retrieval methods such as the Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm can only converge to the phase image under light that is sufficiently coherent. From our simulations, we find that our method consistently produces correlations of over 99% with the original phase image, using either incoherent or coherent light and only 10% as many basis elements as the number of pixels in the image. We believe this result is a strong indication that this method will be able to reliably retrieve a direct phase image in the laboratory.</p>

                    The  guiding  center  code  ORBIT  was  originally  developed  30  years  ago  to  study  the
drift-orbit effects of charged particles in the strong guiding magnetic fields of tokamaks.  Today,
ORBIT  remains  a  very  active  tool  in  magnetic-confinement  fusion  research  and  continues  to
adapt  to  the  latest  toroidal  devices,  such  as  the  NSTX-Upgrade,  for  which  it  plays  a  very
important role in the study of energetic particle effects.  Although the capabilities of ORBIT
have improved throughout the years, the code still remains a serial application, which has now
become an impediment to the lengthy simulations required for the NSTX-U project.  In this
work, multi-threaded parallelism is introduced in the core of the code with the goal of achieving
the largest performance improvement while minimizing changes made to the source code.  To
that  end,  we  introduce  compiler  directives  in  the  most  compute-intensive  parts  of  the  code,
which  constitutes  the  stable  core  that  seldom  changes.   Standard  OpenMP directives  are
used for shared-memory CPU multi-threading while newly developed OpenACC directives
and CUDA Fortran code are used for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) multi-threading.  Our
data shows that the fully-optimized CUDA Fortran version is 53.6 times faster than the original code.
